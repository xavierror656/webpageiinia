# Predictive Maintenance: Complete Guide

[Placeholder Content]

**Predictive maintenance** represents a paradigm shift in how industries manage their assets. Instead of waiting for equipment to fail or performing preventive maintenance on fixed schedules, predictive maintenance uses data and analytics to anticipate when failures will occur.

## Key Benefits

- **Cost reduction**: Up to 25% savings in maintenance
- **Higher uptime**: Fewer unplanned stops
- **Extended lifespan**: Equipment lasts longer
- **Improved safety**: Fewer accidents from failures

## Technologies Involved

### IoT Sensors

Monitor conditions such as:
- Temperature
- Vibration
- Energy consumption
- Acoustic noise

### Machine Learning

Algorithms that learn normal patterns and detect anomalies.

### Edge Computing

Real-time processing near the sensors.

## Success Stories

Our clients have seen:
- 65% reduction in unplanned downtime
- ROI in less than 18 months
- 30% increase in maintenance efficiency
